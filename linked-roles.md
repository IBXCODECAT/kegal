# You must Authorize via the game!

Hey! To get the linked role for our games, you'll need to play the game and authorize Discord through the game itself, rather than using the linked role menu in Discord.

Once you're in the game, there will be an option to link your Discord account. Just follow the prompts, and once you've authorized it, your linked role will automatically be assigned to you on Discord.

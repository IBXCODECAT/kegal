# IBX Translator Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
IBX Translator does not collect any user data. The only data processed is the information received from the Discord API, which is used solely for the purpose of fulfilling translation requests. This data is processed in real-time and is immediately discarded after the translation is completed.

## Use of Discord API Data
The data obtained from the Discord API is exclusively used to process translation requests initiated by users. No user data is stored, logged, or retained after the translation process is complete. IBX Translator does not track or analyze user behavior.

## Third-Party Access
IBX Translator does not share any data with third parties. The translation process is confined to the interaction between the user and the Discord bot. No external entities have access to the data processed during translation.

## Security Measures
While IBX Translator ensures the secure processing of data during translation, it is essential to note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Users should be aware of potential risks associated with the use of any online service.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
Nathan Schmitt (IBXCODECAT) reserves the right to update and modify this privacy policy as needed. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policy periodically for any changes. Continued use of the service implies acceptance of the updated privacy policy.

## Contact Information
For any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact the developer **ibxcodecat** on Discord via Direct Message.
